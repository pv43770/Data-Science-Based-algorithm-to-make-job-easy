In this Code, we've walked through a practical implementation of similarity search in hotel reviews using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. 
By leveraging these techniques, we can streamline the process of finding relevant information amidst a sea of text data.
Whether you're a traveler seeking the perfect hotel or a data enthusiast delving into NLP, this code provides a valuable tool for extracting insights from textual reviews.

The Code Breakdown:
Let's dissect the code step by step:

1. Loading Data:
   We start by loading the hotel reviews data from an Excel file using pandas. 

2. Preprocessing Text:
   Before we can analyze text data, we need to preprocess it. 
This involves converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords (common words like 'and', 'the', etc.), and tokenizing the text into words.
NLTK's stopwords list and word_tokenize function come in handy here.
Note:Its my code to demonstrate my Idea so I haven't properly cleaned my text. however cleaning the dataset before implementing this function is mandatory.

3. TF-IDF Vectorization:
   TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents. 
We utilize scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to transform our preprocessed text into numerical vectors.

4. Cosine Similarity Calculation:
   Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar two documents are irrespective of their size.
We compute cosine similarity between the user's input and all the reviews in our dataset. This helps us identify reviews that are most similar to the user's query.

5. Retrieving Top Similar Reviews:
   Finally, we retrieve the top N most similar reviews based on the cosine similarity scores.
These reviews are then presented to the user for their perusal.
