Here are some benefits of This algorithm:

1. **Data Visualization**: 
    This algorithm utilizes popular data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create box plots and swarm plots, 
    which provide a visual summary of the distribution of scores in your dataset.
    This visualization helps in understanding the spread, central tendency, and presence of outliers in the data.

2. **Identification of Outliers**: 
    By incorporating statistical techniques within the loop, this algorithm efficiently identifies outliers in each score column (math, reading, writing).
    Outliers can provide valuable insights into the data quality and potential anomalies that may affect the analysis results.

3. **Quantile-based Outlier Detection**: 
    This algorithm uses the interquartile range (IQR) method to detect outliers, which is a robust statistical measure.
    This approach considers the spread of the data and is less sensitive to extreme values compared to other outlier detection methods.

4. **Customizable Visualization**: 
    The algorithm allows for customization of the plot aesthetics, such as color palettes, marker styles, and plot size,
    providing flexibility in presenting the results according to preferences or specific requirements.

5. **Informative Output**: 
    The algorithm generates informative output by printing the count and values of lower and upper outliers for each score column.
    This helps in gaining insights into the extent and distribution of outliers in the dataset.

6. **Scalability**: 
    The algorithm can be easily scaled to handle larger datasets by leveraging the efficiency of Pandas for data manipulation and visualization libraries for plotting. 
    This scalability ensures that the algorithm remains effective even with increased data volume.

Overall, this algorithm combines the power of data visualization, statistical analysis, and informative output to effectively identify and visualize outliers in the dataset,
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in data analysis tasks.
